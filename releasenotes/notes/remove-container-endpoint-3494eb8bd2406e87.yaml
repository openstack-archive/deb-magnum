    Magnum service type and mission statement was changed [1].

    Change service type from "Container service" to "Container Infrastructure
    Management service". In addition, the mission statement is changed to
    "To provide a set of services for provisioning, scaling, and managing
    container orchestration engines."

    The intend is to narrow the scope of the Magnum project to focus on
    integrating container orchestration engines (COEs) with OpenStack.
    API features intended to uniformly create, manage, and delete
    individual containers across any COE will be removed from Magnum's
    API, and will be re-introduced as a separate project called Zun.

upgrade:
  - All container/pod/service/replication controller operations were removed.
    Users are recommended to use the COE's native tool (i.e. docker, kubectl)
    to do the equivalent of the removed operations.
