features:
  - Emit notifications when there is an event on a cluster. An event could be
    a status change of the cluster due to an operation issued by end-users
    (i.e. users create, update or delete the cluster). Notifications are sent
    by using oslo.notify and PyCADF. Ceilometer can capture the events and
    generate samples for auditing, billing, monitoring, or quota purposes.
