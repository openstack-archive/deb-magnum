features:
  - Add configuration for overlay networks for the docker
    network driver in swarm. To use this feature, users need
    to create a swarm cluster with network_driver set to 'docker'.
    After the cluster is created, users can create an overlay network
    (docker network create -d overlay mynetwork) and use it when
    launching a new container (docker run --net=mynetwork ...).
