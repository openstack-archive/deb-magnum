features:
  - Add docker-storage-driver parameter to baymodel to
    allow user select from the supported drivers. Until
    now, only devicemapper was supported. This release
    adds support for OverlayFS on Fedora Atomic hosts with
    kernel version >= 3.18 (Fedora 22 or higher) resulting
    significant performance improvement. To use OverlayFS,
    SELinux must be enabled and in enforcing mode on the
    physical machine, but must be disabled in the container.
    Thus, if you select overlay for docker-storage-driver
    SELinux will be disable inside the containers.
