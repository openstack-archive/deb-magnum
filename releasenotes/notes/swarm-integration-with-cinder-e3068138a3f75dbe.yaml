features:
  - Integrate Docker Swarm Fedora Atomic driver with the
    Block Storage Service (cinder). The rexray volume
    driver was added based on rexray v0.4. Users can
    create and attach volumes using docker's navive
    client and they will authenticate using the per
    cluster trustee user. Rexray can be either added
    in the Fedora Atomic image or can be used running
    in a container.
