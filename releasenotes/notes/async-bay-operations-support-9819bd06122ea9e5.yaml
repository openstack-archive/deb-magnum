features:
  - Current implementation of magnum bay operations are
    synchronous and as a result API requests are blocked
    until response from HEAT service is received. This release
    adds support for asynchronous bay operations (bay-create,
    bay-update, and bay-delete). Please note that with this
    change, bay-create, bay-update API calls will return bay uuid
    instead of bay object and also return HTTP status code 202
    instead of 201. Microversion 1.2 is added for new behavior.

upgrade:
  - Magnum bay operations API default behavior changed from
    synchronous to asynchronous. User can specify
    OpenStack-API-Version 1.1 in request header for synchronous
    bay operations.
