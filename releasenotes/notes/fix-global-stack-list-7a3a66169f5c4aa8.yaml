security:
  - Fix global stack list in periodic task. In before, magnum's periodic task
    performs a `stack-list` operation across all tenants. This is disabled
    by Heat by default since it causes a security issue. At this release,
    magnum performs a `stack-get` operation on each Heat stack by default.
    This might not be scalable and operators have an option to fall back to
    `stack-list` by setting the config `periodic_global_stack_list` to
    `True` (`False` by default) and updating the heat policy file (usually
    /etc/heat/policy.json) to allow magnum list stacks.
